# expense_extrapolator
A tool for tracking my expenses

Using sample monthly expense, I created a way to visualize whether I'm over spending or underspending.
An upward trend line means I'm spending more each month, an downward trend line means I'm spending less each month.
Ideally I want to be downward trending or flat, intercepting with the vertical axis at where my monthly budget is at.
